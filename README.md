Manage Cloud Storage Lifecycle Policy using gcloud storage
Cloud Storage Lifecycle Management (GCP)
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Google Cloud Storage lifecycle policies to automatically manage files based on how frequently they are accessed.
The goal is to reduce storage cost while keeping important files easily available.

The lifecycle policy is applied to a Cloud Storage bucket that contains:

1.Active project files

2.Archived documents

3.Temporary log files
